Cloud computing is shared pools of configurable computer system resources and higher-level 
services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the 
Internet.


Third-party clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending 
resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance.[1] Advocates note that cloud computing 
allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim 
that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with 
improved manageability and less maintenance.
