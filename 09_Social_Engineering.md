Social engineering is an act of stealing information from humans.

- No interaction with target system or network
- Non-technical attack
- Convincing the target to reveal information

One of the major vulnerability which leads to this type of attack is "**Trust**".
User trust in another user and does not secure their credentials from them.

Employees are uneducated at organizations, so this is a major vulnerability. 

Lack of security policies and privacy are also vulnerable.

### Steps of Social Engineering

#### Research

- Collection of information from the target organization
- Collected by dumpster diving, scanning, serach on the internet, ...

#### Select target

- Select the tagret among other employees
- A frustrated target is more prefered

#### Relationship

- Create relationship with the target
- Earn the trust

#### Exploit

- Collecting sensitive information such as usernames, password, etc...

# Social Engineering Techniques

##Types of Social Engineering

### Human-based Social Engineering

One-to-one interaction with the target. Earn the trust to gather sensitive information from the target.

#### Impersonation

Pretend to be something or someone, pretending to be a legitimate user or authorized person.
Impersonation is perfomed by indentity theft.

#### Eavesdropping and Shoulder Surfing

Eavesdropping is a technique in which attacker is revealed information by listening to the conversation.
Reading or accessing any source of information without being notified.

Shoulder Surfing is a method of gathering information by standing behind the target.

#### Dumpster Diving

Looking for treasure in trash.

#### Reverse Social Engineering

The attacker convinces the target of having a problem or might have in the future to get sensitive information.

#### Piggybacking and Tailgating

Piggybank is a technique in which attacker waits for an authorized person to gain entry in a restricted area.
Tailgating is a technique in which attacker gains access to the restricted area by following the authorized person.

### Computer-based Social Engineering

#### Phishing

Attacker send fake emails which looks like legitimate email. When recipient opens the link, he is enticed for providing information.

#### Spear Phishing

Similar as phishing but it is focused on one target. Because of this, it is generate higher response rate.

### Mobile-based Social Engineering

#### Publishing Malicious Apps

These applications are normally a replica or similar copy of a popular application.

#### Repackaging Legitimate Apps

Repack a legitimate app with a malware.

#### Fake Security Apps

Attacker develop a fake security app.

### Insider Attack

Social Engineering is not all about a third person gathering information, it may be an insider with privileges.
