<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Hack Value</strong>: A notion among hackers that something is worth doing or is interesting.</li><li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Existence of a weakness, design, or implementation error that can lead to an unexpected event compromising the security of the system.</li><li><strong>Exploit</strong>: A breach of IT system security through vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Payload</strong>: Payload is the part of an exploit code that performs the intended malicious action, such as destroying, creating backdoors, and hijacking computer.</li><li><strong>Zero-Day Attack</strong>: An attack that exploits computer application vulnerabilities before the software developer releases a patch for the vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Daisy Chaining</strong>: It involves gaining access to one network and/or computer and then using the same information to gain access to multiple networks and computers that contain desirable information.</li><li><strong>Doxing</strong>: Publishing personally identifiable information about an individual collected from publicly available databases and social media.</li><li><strong>Bot</strong> : A "bot" is a software application that can be controlled remotely to execute or automate predefined tasks.</li></ul>

<h3>Elements of Information Security</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Assurance that the information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.</li><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: The trustworthiness of data or resource in terms of preventing improper and unauthorized changes.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by the authorized users.</li><li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: Refers to the characteristic of a communication, document or any data that ensures the quality of being genuine.</li><li><strong>Non-Repudiation</strong>: Guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message.</li></ul>

<h3>The Security, Functionality, and Usability triangle</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li> <strong>Security</strong>: Restrictions imposed on accessing the components of the system (restrictions). </li><li><strong>Functionality</strong>: The set of features provided by the system (features). </li><li><strong>Usability</strong>: The GUI components used to design the system for ease of use (GUI).</li></ul>

<h3>Information Security Attacks and Attack Vectors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A motive originates out of the notion that the target system stores or  process something valuable and this leads to threat of an attack on the system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attackers try various tools and attacks techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system or security policy and controls to achive their motives.</p>
