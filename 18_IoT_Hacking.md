The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of devices, vehicles, and home appliances that contain electronics, software, actuators, 
and connectivity which allows these things to connect, interact and exchange data.
IoT involves extending Internet connectivity beyond standard devices, such as desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets, to any 
range of traditionally dumb or non-internet-enabled physical devices and everyday objects. Embedded with technology, these devices 
can communicate and interact over the Internet, and they can be remotely monitored and controlled.
